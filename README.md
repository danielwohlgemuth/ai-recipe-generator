# Build a Serverless Web Application using Generative AI

This repo is based on the [Build a Serverless Web Application using Generative AI](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-amplify-bedrock-cognito-gen-ai/) tutorial that uses AWS Amplify to build a serverless web application powered by Generative AI using Amazon Bedrock and the Claude 3 Sonnet foundation model.

Install the dependencies with `npm install`. Run the local server with `npm run dev` and spin up the Amplify sandbox with `npx ampx sandbox`.

You might need to run `npx ampx configure profile` to set up the AWS credentials.
